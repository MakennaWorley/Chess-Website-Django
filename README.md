# ChessWeb
 
This is an extension of my final Project for Databases (see my Chess-Website_LAMP Repo for that code) which is used for the local chess club I volunteer at to update their players' ratings and pair the next meets matches. This code will eventually be published on my personal website once it is ready.

I'm hopeful to have this open to all clubs wanting to use this when it is posted to my website.

For any other clubs wanting to use this code, you are completely free to download and run this on your own machine. This also extends to anyone wanting to fork this project for other uses!
