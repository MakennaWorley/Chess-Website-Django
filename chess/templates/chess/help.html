        <h2>Home</h2>
        <p class="indent">This is a high level overview of the data stored on the website.</p>
        <p class="indent">On the left, you can see the names, ratings, grade, and coaches of the students top 10 students.
            I will add a checkbox to toggle the teachers into the list.</p>
        <p class="indent">This also shows the Classes that are available for any student to be assigned to which will be
            reflected in the exported rating sheet!</p>
        <p class="indent">On the right, you can see the number of games per week and the date of the match. This can be used
            to reference if next week's pairings have been made!</p>
        
        <h2>Search</h2>
            <p class="indent">This is where you can search for any specific keyword in the database.</p>
            <p class="indent">The "Searching for" selection means where you want to search. Like if you want to search through
                all possible players, all possible games, or all players in a specific class.</p>
            <p class="indent">I will also add a little pencil icon which would let you edit that specific result.</p>
        
        <h2>Manual Change</h2>
            <p class="indent">This hasn't been added yet, but this is where you can add a class or player manually. Or set
                up the database for the next year.</p>
        
        <h2>Input Results</h2>
            <p class="indent">This hasn't been added yet, but this is where you would search up the date and add the results.
                With any subsitution that happened, you will have to edit that row manually. On submission, this will then
                update all the ratings based on the result of the game. Once you see a "success" message, there will be a "download
                Pairings" button. It is also safe to go to "Pair" and pair your next week of games!</p>
        
        <h2>Pair</h2>
            <p class="indent">This hasn't been added yet, but this is where you would have the computer do the pairings! If
                you have a specific match (such as a teacher vs student) in mind, you need to add those games BEFORE you hit
                "Pair!" After a success message, you will now have a "Download Pairings" button.</p>
