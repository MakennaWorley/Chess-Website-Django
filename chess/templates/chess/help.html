        <h1>Help page</h1>
        <h2>Home</h2>
        <p class="indent">On the home page, you can see the current ratings as stored in the database or pairings for any week
            in the database.</p>
        
        <p class="indent">There will also be a small pencil icon to the right of each entry, which will let you edit that paricular
            entry</p>
        <p class="indent">There will also have a search bar feature, this will hopefully dynamically search as you type.</p>
        
        <h2>Manual Change</h2>
            <p class="indent">This hasn't been added yet, but this is where you can add a class or player manually. Or set
                up the database for the next year.</p>
        
        <h2>Input Results</h2>
            <p class="indent">This hasn't been added yet, but this is where you would search up the date and add the results.
                With any substitution that happened, you will have to edit that row manually. On submission, this will then
                update all the ratings based on the result of the game. Once you see a "success" message it is also safe to
                go to "Pair" and pair your next week of games!</p>
            <p class="indent">Or you can click the "Download Ratings" which will download the current ratings of all players to
                your computer. Keep in mind, that this also makes a fild on the server too. So check the list of ratings to see
                if a rating sheet has already been made for this week!</p>
        
        <h2>Pair</h2>
            <p class="indent">This hasn't been added yet, but this is where you would have the computer do the pairings! If
                you have a specific match (such as a teacher vs student) in mind, you need to add those games BEFORE you hit
                "Pair!" After a success message, you can head over to "Download" tab.</p>
